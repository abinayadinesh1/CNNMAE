# ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders
### aka a fully convolutionally masked autoencoder 

anshul and i found a cool paper, so we reading group-ed it and did this implementation (without looking at any of their code!) 
it took 16 hours, spread over 2 days during winter break!
